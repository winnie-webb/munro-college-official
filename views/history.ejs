By this Act, the Trustees were given power of sale of the real estate and slaves of Robert Hugh Munro and Caleb Dickenson for investing the funds and applying the same to the purposes of their wills and for no other purpose.
The Trustees were appointed to select a convenient and healthy site or sites within the former limits of St. Elizabeth for erection of a school or several schools for poor boys and a school or several schools for poor girls and for an Alms House.
